CSCvp66716,CSCvp66716,Lgx00155589: Boundary Clock Does not Respond to IGMP Query,"iot-15.2(7)E1,ra-found -OIB",I've been working on a proof of concept test for a customer large scale PTP system.  The customer's architecture has a Cisco Catalyst 3750 series as the distribution and a number of Stratix 8000 switches as access switches.  The customer needs to synchronize time across the system for alarms and events.  The Stratix switches are configured as boundary clocks and are using the native VLAN to pass time across the 3750.  All of the Stratix switches and the 3750 have IP addresses assigned to the native VLAN interfaces.  The 3750 is filtering PTP multicast traffic between the Stratix switches and not allowing the system to synchronize.  When I look at the igmp snooping groups I see 224.0.1.129 for the access VLANs but I do not see it listed for the native VLAN.  If I disable IGMP snooping on the 3750 the system synchronizes.  I can also add static snooping entries for 224.0.1.129 and the system will synchronize across the native VLAN.It does not appear that the boundary clock in the Stratix 8000 responds to the general query.  Because of this the 3750 cannot forward the PTP traffic between the Stratix boundary clocks.Refer: CSCuq21253,Missing,Missing,Missing,Missing,nobug,"Lgx00155589: Boundary Clock Does not Respond to IGMP Queryiot-15.2(7)E1,ra-found -OIBI've been working on a proof of concept test for a customer large scale PTP system.

On a 16GB SD card (inserted into a Windows laptop), we copied 4 individual files, each having 1GB of data.2. We then inserted that SD card to a Moreno unit. This Moreno unit had a 1MB file on its flash.3. We copied the 1MB file from flash to sdflash.4. Copy seemed fine and NO errors were noticed. Executed ?dir sdflash:? command and the file sizes did not give any hint of data corruption.5. Removed the SD card from the Moreno unit and connected back to the Windows laptop.6. Tried reading the files on the SD Card and noticed that the 1st file now contained the data from the 1MB file and the 1MB file contained some junk data.7. We then tried our tests by having 2GB of data on the SD and then copying an additional 1MB to it but we did NOT notice any issues. Similarly having 3GB of data on the SD card also did not show any issues.8. So in summary we noticed that when the SD card has 4GB of data, copying an additional 1MB corrupts the 1st file in the SD card.It appears that there is a 32-bit unsigned integer overflow somewhere in the code.

On a 16GB SD card (inserted into a Windows laptop), we copied 4 individual files, each having 1GB of data.2. We then inserted that SD card to a Moreno unit. This Moreno unit had a 1MB file on its flash.3. We copied the 1MB file from flash to sdflash.4. Copy seemed fine and NO errors were noticed. Executed ?dir sdflash:? command and the file sizes did not give any hint of data corruption.5. Removed the SD card from the Moreno unit and connected back to the Windows laptop.6. Tried reading the files on the SD Card and noticed that the 1st file now contained the data from the 1MB file and the 1MB file contained some junk data.7. We then tried our tests by having 2GB of data on the SD and then copying an additional 1MB to it but we did NOT notice any issues. Similarly having 3GB of data on the SD card also did not show any issues.8.
